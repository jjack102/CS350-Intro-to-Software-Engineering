# Test-Driven Development 
I worked on CashRegister.java and TestRegister.java. The test file worked on Test-Driven Development (TDD). TDD is an enhanced version of Test-First Development (TFD) designed for use with incremental development. The emphasis is on quick cycling between testing and implementation, with each cycle typically a matter of a few minutes.
