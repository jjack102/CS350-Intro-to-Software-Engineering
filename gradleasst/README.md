# Build Manager - Gradle
In a Gradle-based Java project, you typically have two main configuration files: settings.gradle and build.gradle. These files define the project's structure, dependencies, and build tasks.

# Deploying Website
GitHub provides a web server (called GitHub Pages) for projects hosted on it. In this build file, I used a static website generator (JBake) to reformat our website content before sending it to our web server.

# Continuous Integration
GitHub Actions is a built-in continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) service provided by GitHub. It allows you to automate various workflows, such as building, testing, and deploying your software directly from your GitHub repository.
